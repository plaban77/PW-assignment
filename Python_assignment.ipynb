    "When to use each:\n",

    "1. Mutable:\n",
    "    - When you need to modify data frequently (e.g., lists for dynamic data).\n",
    "    - When you need to conserve memory (e.g., modifying a large list in-place).\n",

    "    - When you need to ensure data integrity (e.g., strings for configuration data).\n",
    "    - When you need to use an object as a dictionary key (e.g., tuples).\n",
